  This pathvisiojs test and development site allows you to edit the pathvisiojs code online at Github and view the results right here in the <b>pathvisiojs (DEV)</b> frame below. To get started, fork the <a href="https://github.com/wikipathways/pathvisiojs">pathvisiojs repo</a> and ask Anders or Alex to add you as an authorized user (authorized users array is in <a href="https://github.com/wikipathways/pathvisiojs/blob/master/remote-data-sources/php/github.php">github.php</a>). If you've already forked the pathvisiojs repo, be sure to pull the latest changes from the master branch of the wikipathways pathvisiojs repo (yourAccount::yourBranch ... wikipathways::master). Then edit the code in any of the files in the "src" folder of your Github fork of pathvisiojs and commit your changes on Github. (You may need to wait a second after committing for Github to apply your changes.) To see the result, return to this page, enter your Account and Branch above and click "Submit." When you're done editing, you can create a pull request on Github (wikipathways::master ... yourAccount::yourBranch) to merge your changes into the master branch of the wikipathways pathvisiojs repo.
