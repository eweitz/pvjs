  This pathvisio.js test and development site allows you to edit the pathvisio.js code online at Github and view the results right here in the <b>pathvisio.js (DEV)</b> frame below. To get started, fork the <a href="https://github.com/wikipathways/pathvisio.js">pathvisio.js repo</a> and ask Anders or Alex to add you as an authorized user (authorized users array is in <a href="https://github.com/wikipathways/pathvisio.js/blob/master/remote-data-sources/php/github.php">github.php</a>). If you've already forked the pathvisio.js repo, be sure to pull the latest changes from the master branch of the wikipathways pathvisio.js repo (yourAccount::yourBranch ... wikipathways::master). Then edit the code in any of the files in the "src" folder of your Github fork of pathvisio.js and commit your changes on Github. (You may need to wait a second after committing for Github to apply your changes.) To see the result, return to this page, enter your Account and Branch above and click "Submit." When you're done editing, you can create a pull request on Github (wikipathways::master ... yourAccount::yourBranch) to merge your changes into the master branch of the wikipathways pathvisio.js repo.
