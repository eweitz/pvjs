How To Get Involved
===================

-----------------
1. Go to https://github.com/wikipathways/pathvisio.js/
2. Click "fork"
3. Go to your fork at https://github.com/your-github-account/pathvisio.js/

Pull latest changes
-------------------
1. Go to your fork of pathvisio.js and make sure you're in the master branch (select "master" in the "branch" drop-down)
2. Select the "Compare and review" button to the left of the "branch" drop-down to pull from the wikipathways fork of pathvisio.js into your fork
3. Select "Edit" and "compare across forks" as needed to make the drop-downs look like this: your-github-account:master ... wikipathways:master
4. Create pull request
5. Accept pull request (if github says that the pull request cannot be done automatically, you will need to merge the files from the command line. Let Anders or Alex know and they can help.)
6. If your fork doesn't yet have a gh-pages branch, follow the step below. Otherwise, pull the latest changes into the gh-pages branch from the master branch of your fork (gh-pages ... master)

3. Pull the code into your fork from the wikipathways fork (your-github-account:gh-pages ... wikipathways:gh-pages)

Make awesome updates
--------------------
1. You can edit any of the files in the "src" directory of the gh-pages branch of your fork (https://github.com/your-github-account/pathvisio.js/tree/gh-pages/src/)
4. View your changes live at http://your-github-account.github.io/pathvisio.js/test/ (note the .IO)

Send pull request
-----------------
1. View each of the test pathways at http://your-github-account.github.io/pathvisio.js/test/ to ensure your code works well
